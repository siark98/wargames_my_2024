# 迅帝

This is the sole challenge in the OSINT category, and the hint does accurately implies that it is troublesome. It is safe to say that, so far, this OSINT challenge has been the most technically demanding of all the OSINT challenges I've encountered in various CTFs.

The zip file contains 2 files - 1 TOC file and 1 DAT file. If this challenge hadn't been labeled as OSINT, we might have mistaken it for a reverse engineering or forensic challenge instead.<br>

So what do we do with the 2 files? From the title, "迅帝" (Jintei/Fast Emperor/Speed King/King Speed) is the boss of the Tokyo Xtreme Racer games series, whereas in the challenge description, the keyword Melancholy Angel is the name of a boss exclusively in Import Tuner Challenge. Hence in this challenge we should focus on researching the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. <br>

After some research, I have found this tool called GUT Archive Tools (https://github.com/igorciz777/GUTArchiveTools), 
used by the video game company Genki, known mostly for their PS2 racing games.And most importantly, it can process DAT and TOC files, bingo! <br> <br>

After some trial and error, 3rd command (For TXR:D2 and alike) works, but -2 game switch is used because of the Melancholy Angel being the exclusive car name in Import Tuner Challenge.
(FYI the hint provided by the organiser later in the CTF shows a trailer of Import Tuner Challenge)

this command "./gut_archive.out -d BUILD.TOC BUILD.DAT BUILD_OUT -2" would produce a directory "BUILD_OUT" with more than 22k files. Note that there will be error showing up after the progress bar reaches 99%, ignore it.

<br>Are you sure it is an OSINT challenge, not rev or forensic?

While I scrolled through the files, I noticed that there are some bin files with thumbnails, and then I saw 00000508.bin, a Melancholy Angel ... with a flag, jackpot! Hence, 'Melancholy Angel holds the flag.'<br>Those "bin" files are actually tga files, but renamed as bin files.

Just use the Ristretto Image Viewer to open the file and expand it.
